My Attempts to complete the Stanford CS106A course via iTunes U

Hello World!

I'm trying to learn programming with some of the great FREE resources provided by Stanford.

I'll start with 106A - Programming Methodology, and then the plan is to move on to 106B - Programming Abstractions
before finally getting to where I want to be, in iPad and iPhone development.

If you're out there and trying this course out yourself, please feel free to comment on anything that I've done,
if you can point out a better way to do it, i'd love to hear from you!

so.. i'm pretty new to this.. and to github, so be patient!
